# File Upload and Search Features

This writeup explains the two features that have been implemented in the code snippet provided. The features are file upload and search functionalities.

## File Upload Feature

The file upload feature enables users to upload files to a directory. The code snippet provided shows how to implement this feature in a React component. When a user selects a file to upload, the `onChange` event is triggered, and the selected files are stored in an array. The `forEach` function is used to loop through each file and create a new object that contains the file's details. The object is then added to the `myFiles` state using the `setMyFiles` function. The `setMyFiles` function updates the state of the `myFiles` variable in the React component, and the new file is displayed in the UI.

Here's an overview of how the file upload feature works:

1. User selects one or more files to upload.
2. The `onChange` event is triggered, and the selected files are stored in an array.
3. The `forEach` function is used to loop through each file and create a new object that contains the file's details.
4. The new object is added to the `myFiles` state using the `setMyFiles` function.
5. The UI is updated to display the newly uploaded files.

## Search Feature

The search feature allows users to search for files in the directory. The code snippet provided shows how to implement this feature in a React component. When a user types a search term in the search input field, the `onChange` event is triggered, and the search term is stored in a variable. The `filter` function is used to loop through each file in the `data` array and return only files that match the search term. The filtered files are then stored in a new array, which is set as the new value of the `myFiles` state using the `setMyFiles` function.

Here's an overview of how the search feature works:

1. User types a search term in the search input field.
2. The `onChange` event is triggered, and the search term is stored in a variable.
3. The `filter` function is used to loop through each file in the `data` array and return only files that match the search term.
4. The filtered files are stored in a new array.
5. The new array is set as the new value of the `myFiles` state using the `setMyFiles` function.
6. The UI is updated to display only files that match the search term.

## Conclusion

In summary, the file upload and search features are essential functionalities for any application that deals with files. The code snippet provided shows how to implement these features in a React component using simple JavaScript functions and React hooks.
